This part of the lab involves creating tickets as a user/client and resolving them as an agent, giving us insight into how osTicket looks and functions from both ends of the system.

We will also be triaging tickets – evaluating, sorting, and assigning based on their severity and urgency.

To get started, navigate to the osTicket Support Center:  http://localhost/osTicket/ 

Select “Open a New Ticket”.

The first ticket will be a Business Critical Outage created by Edward Rochester (user generated previously).

Input the respective detailed outlines in the screenshot and click “Create Ticket”.

Repeat the same steps for Irma Laire, Charlie Brown, and Angelica Pickles.

While we did not explicitly configure Charlie Brown and Angelica Pickles as users on the system, it is possible to generate new users by generating tickets through the Support Center page as we had disabled the “require registration” feature previously.
